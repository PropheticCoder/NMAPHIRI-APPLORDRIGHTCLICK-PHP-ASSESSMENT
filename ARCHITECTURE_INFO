PHPVERSION: 7.4.2
ARCHITECTURE NAME: ARCHITECTURE CUSTOM CREATED FOR RECRUIITMENT TEST
DETAILS:
The architecture is based on the clean code architecture, it serves to move away core processes from the public domain,
By parsing data into the core classes which are the entities of the API.

DATA FLOW: UI->ENDPOINT->CONTROLLER->ADAPATER->ENTITY->ADAPATER->CONTROLLER->ENDPOINT->UI.

Take not the core is the entities.

This Architecture Allows Us To Get A Project Ready Quicker As The Class Setup Is Not Complicated
